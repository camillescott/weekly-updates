## Lamprey

### Finished

* Finished the abundance estimation pipeline. Uses the same metadata as the rest of the preprocessing pipeline, along with the `pydoit` task API. Steps are:
    1. Build bowtie2 index for assembly
    2. Extract paired reads and split
    3. Run bowtie2-align with loose parameters
    4. Run eXpress
    5. Aggregate results into final abundance matrix
* Running new abundance estimation pipeline on lamp3
    1. Many delays this week from HPC scheduler issues
    2. Still waiting on the paired-end samples to finish (these took longest and were cut short)

### TODO next
* Use new abundance info to build gene models from existing transcripts
* Get detailed comparison metrics between existing gene models, transcript alignments, and new transcript-based gene models
* Finalize reproducible pipeline
    1. Finish data management plan (git-annex? where to host?)
    2. Finish unifying metadata, task dependency between pre-processing, Trinity, and post-processing
    3. Test entire pipeline on EC2

## khmer multiprocessing

### Finished

* Introduced new state management system for all `Async` subclasses
    1. 4 states: START, DORMANT, RUNNING, WAIT
        1. START: state prior to constructor call
        2. DORMANT: State during construction, before call to `start()`, after calling `stop()`
        3. RUNNING: Reset all counters, spawn threads for `consume()` function (ie, begin processing reads)
        4. WAIT: Reached once the current parser is empty, or generally, once all processing is complete; `start()` can reset and return to RUNNING, `stop()` transitions to DORMANT
    2. State is shared between all threads of any `Async` object
    3. Externally accessible, thread-safe functions for setting and retrieving state
    4. Fixed several deadlocking issues that were difficult to diagnose with previous non-generalized state system
* `AsyncParser` is now it's own `Async` subclass, instead of being built into `AsyncSequenceProcessor`, allowing easier state management with the new system and a more extensible system for parsing. Also allows the `AsyncSequenceProcessor` more flexibility in where it receives reads from, and easier testing.
* Removed all `AsyncWriter` classes, as hashtables are now entirely threadsafe and all writing is handled directly by `Hashtable`
* Added more robust / safe initialization of `Hashtable` thread safety

### TODO Next
* Fix remaining deadlock in `AsyncDiginorm`
* Flesh out tests
* Add output callback system previously discussed
